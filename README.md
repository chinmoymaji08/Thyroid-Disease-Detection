# problem Statement:
Thyroid disease is a common health issue that is challenging to predict in medical research. The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in regulating our body's metabolism by releasing hormones. There are two main thyroid conditions: hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). The goal is to predict a patient's risk of developing thyroid disease.
