# problem Statement:
Thyroid disease is a common health issue that is challenging to predict in medical research. The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in regulating our body's metabolism by releasing hormones. There are two main thyroid conditions: hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). The goal is to predict a patient's risk of developing thyroid disease.

# Approach:
1. Data Exploration: Understand and analyze the data.
2. Data Cleaning: Remove or correct any errors in the data.
3. Feature Engineering: Create and select relevant features (variables) that will help in making predictions.
4. Model Building: Use different machine learning algorithms to create models.
5. Model Testing: Evaluate and compare the models to find the best one for predicting thyroid disease.
